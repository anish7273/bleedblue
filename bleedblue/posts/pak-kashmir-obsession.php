        <u>Obsessive Compulsive Disorder or OCD</u> is a mental situation where a one thinks excessively about one compulsion only. Its the same thing that’s stuck in the Pakistan’s cache over past seven decades.<br><br>

The Islamic Republic has already spent 74 years in its vague obsession and the world’s still unclear why our dear Neighbor's eyeing in our domain. In our quest to find the answer to the trivial question, Pakistan appears to have a long history crying for Kashmir for absolutely no reason at all. The poor country has already fought four losing battles just to appease its vague obsession.<br><br>

Well in this large world of over  a hundred and ninety five nations, only Pakistan’s that lone wolf that is daring to challenge the mighty Mammoth. I mean, these guys have fought four wars with us only to see the face of defeat each and every time, their economy is facing the blade from all the four corners of the room, their foreign debt is soaring up to more than 50% of their GDP amounting at colossus $112 Billion, their budgets are slashing  year by year, their military expenditure is decreasing exponentially, their government is begging the world over and still they dare to dream of Kashmir.<br><br>

Now tell me, have you ever witnessed such a spirit. When you don’t even stand a chance against the adversary and still you dare to stand-up. &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp<u><br>Truly Recommendable </u><br><br>

But their dream just don’t stop there. Pakistan’s thirst for Kashmir is so huge that they don’t even bother begging for that. Their Wazir-e-Ala,Imran Khan have been  seen multiple times begging for  international cooperation and foreign intervention for their wild dreams but none seems to pay heed to Pakistan. This guy hasn’t left any stone unturned be it the UN General Assembly or the Organization of Islamic Cooperation or OIC as it is better known as and for once again the results have been quite unpleasant for Pakistan. <br><br>

<img class="d-block ml-auto mr-auto img-fluid" style="border-radius:8px;border:1px solid #c0c0c0;margin-bottom:50px;" src="../post/pak-beg.jfif" alt="pak-begging">
<p class="img-caption caption text-center" style="margin-top:-50px;font-size:0.8em;border-bottom:50px">An Artist’s Impression of Pakistan</p>
 


I’m telling you this guy Imran Khan Niyazi is so obsessed with our little heaven that he can stoop to any low for it. I’ll tell you one short incident that happened with this guy last year. In the 74th session of UN General Assembly each member state was given about 15 minutes of time to address key issues/achievements of the state. You won’t believe me this guy , Pakistan’s Wazir sahib went on for more than 50 minutes. But as it was decided that one will be given 15 minutes to speak about its state, Imran Sir followed the suite he spoke on his nation for 15 minutes only and dedicated the next 35 minutes muttering his concocted stories.<br><br>

<img class="d-block ml-auto mr-auto  img-fluid" style="border-radius:8px;border:1px solid #c0c0c0;margin-bottom:50px;" src="../post/pak-unga.jfif" alt="Pak at UNGA">
<p class="img-caption caption text-center" style="margin-top:-50px;font-size:0.8em;border-bottom:50px">Imran Khan at UNGA.</p>
 

Sometimes I envy this guy badly, I wish even I had the same level of creativity to realize the fantasy. Such a star he is. But this isn’t the end of the story, Wazir Sahib is not the only day dreamer in Pakistan, infact the state is full of such hypocrites that too in dozens.<br><br>

<h3>Shah Mahmood Qureshi- The Motor Mouth</h3>

Qureshi sahib is totally next level, he is the king of his own world. And even this king has the same dream as does his Wazir-e-Ala- Kashmir. But as I told you he’s even one step ahead of Imran Khan.<br><br>

In the gone weeks Qureshi declared a lone battle against the leader of the Islamic world-<b> Saudi Arabia. </b> Qureshi even said-<br>
“Saudi needs to choose if it wants to support the founding members on its key issue or not. The time has come for the OIC to stop its waiting game and to respond.” He went on and openly challenged Saudi’s OIC leadership and threatened to pull out and form a separate bloc of Muslim Nations if their demand on Kashmir is not met.<br><br>

Well how can you even dare to say this to someone that too when he’s the one whose loans have kept your nation still afloat. It may have happen that Qureshi did forgot of the fat cheques they received from  Saudi. Well isn’t that strange, keeping in mind that Qureshi’s the foreign affairs minister of Pakistan. After all it’s an old custom inPakistan of bumbling up things badly.<br><br>

<h2><u>Saudi and it’s Indo-Pak Ties</u></h2>

Saudi has been the accepted leader of the Arabic world be it its economic stronghold or its religious sentiments being home to Mecca and Medina. Saudi has been one of the most important diplomatic partner of Pakistan but Pakistan is slowly but steadily losing its ties with the Saudi. Saudi too seems to align its interests the other way around, they have decided not to favor Pakistan just due to its religious similarities. After all one can’t simply live on the Saudi cash on the one side and on the other hand rebuking them publicly. This time even Saudi has decided to show its cards.<br><br>

Saudi has snubbed Pakistan halting its massive $6.2 Billion loan it gave Pakistan a couple of years back in 2018.Back then the newly elected Imran Khan government had managed the $6.2 Billion loan to keep the cash strapped nation running of which $3 Billion was parked by Saudi in their Reserve Bank and another $3.2 Billion in Oil. But as the recent developments say Saudi has called back $1 Billion from the fixed amount of $3 Billion and has also halted the $3.2 Billion Oil supplies with immediate effect. And as the sources suggest, the remaining $2 Billion can also be snatched by the Saudi very soon.<br><br>

Well this seemed quite obvious with motor-mouths like Qureshi and Fawad Ahmed Chaudhary in your government. <br><br>

Now as the Saudi has responded, Pakistan has started to feel the heat. Consequently, Pakistan Army  Chief General Qamar Javed Bajwa was on a visit to Saudi to mend the already bumbling strings between the two nations. Although they say that this trip was a pre-planned one to enhance the military ties between the two but even you know what’s the reality? <br><br>

And as they say “<i>Ab pachtaye hot kya, Jab chidiya chug gayi khet</i> ”. General Bajwa received a royal snub in the  Sheikhdom. He couldn’t even arrange a meeting with the Crown Prince Mohammad Bin Salman, forget about repairing the done damage.<br><br>

<h3><u>Increasing Arab-India Ties</u></h3>

As the Pakistan’s relations with the Arab Nations continues to deteriorate, on the same time the ties of these nations with India are on the rise. It has happened first time in history that the Arab nations are backing India on the Kashmir’s stand. Its like rubbing salt on already fresh wounds of Pakistan. Pakistan stands on the verge of OIC too and if you remember correctly in the previous OIC summit India was welcomed by the host UAE as an observer nation against the will of Pakistan. This has been a significant Geo-political win for India. Many Muslim majority countries now withstands India with the only exception of Turkey  and Malaysia.<br><br>

 The Arab nations are further looking to boost their ties with India be it trade deals, defense cooperation, intelligence sharing or honoring our PM with their highest Civilian Award.<br><br>

<img class="d-block ml-auto mr-auto  img-fluid" style="border-radius:8px;border:1px solid #c0c0c0;margin-bottom:50px;" src="../post/pak-modi-uae.jfif" alt="UAE">
<p class="img-caption caption text-center" style="margin-top:-50px;font-size:0.8em;border-bottom:50px">PM Modi being honored by UAE</p>
 

<h2><u>Conclusion</u></h2>

These changes mark the changing geopolitics in the Western Asia. While Pakistan’s Obsession for Kashmir has made sure no Arab nation or otherwise any nation stands by it. On the other hand the gap between India and the middle-east has been shrinking continuously at an unprecedented rate.<br><br>

Just see the most recent development of setting up of diplomatic relations between UAE and the Israel, the relations marking the beginning of a new era. The era of peace and harmony in West-Asia.<br><br>
