<p>Have your ears drums been shattered by this news of a whopping  400 Billion Dollar investment by  China in Iran?  I hope they aren't because mine have already blown out. Even the doctors are having a hectic schedule now-a-days, I'm already struggling to get their appointments. While I book an appointment for myself, why don't you have a deeper insight into the matter?<br>
It's been universally said & accepted,<b>" Your enemy's enemy is your potential friend.'' </b>Our dear neighbor  has taken it too seriously. China's growing hostility with the United States has brought it much closer to the oil-rich Iran. China has promised to invest <b>$400 Billion in Iran's economy in the span of next 25 year. </b>Well this amount is so emphatic that you and me can't even imagine this. To get to know a bit of the weight of this amount, consider the case of Pakistan. While Pakistan is drowning in Chinese debts all from head to toe, it owes China roughly $50 billion when only $50billion is enough to curb a nation. Just assume <b>what havocs can $400 billions do?</b> But what's  attracting China so much into this deal? Well there is more than one answer to this. Let's look at a few of these one-by one. <br>
Iran has been a war-struck Nation, that faces a hell lot of issues on the global fronts such as-<br><ul>    
<li>Iran has  been blacklisted by the UN's FATF body.</li>
    <li>Iran doesn't enjoy any diplomatic relations with many world-leading economies.</li>
<li> US sanctions on  nations having bilateral trade relations with Iran.</li></ul>
But even these factors don't look quite adequate to Iran from becoming the next prey to the China's debt trap diplomacy. Let's look at it more briefly.</p><br>

<h2><u>China's Debt Trap Policy</u></h2>
<p>Ever since the<b> Chinese Belt and Road Initiative</b> came into existence, China has been deliberately following<b> Modern day Colonialism </b> and Iran's slowly falling into it.<br>
Under its hook, China tends to loan excessive amounts of credit to lure various underdeveloped nations in Sub-Saharan Africa and Southern Asia.<br>
While these nations can't afford such expenditures, the huge amounts tend to corrupt their calculation. Then comes the game of Chinese debt traps into action. While most of the terms regarding the loan are not put into public domain, neither by China nor its prey and at the same time China also makes sure  that only the Chinese companies are the ones benefiting from these projects. Or the other way around,<b> there isn't any meaning of development for the host Country</b> but to squash them under piles of debt  that in many cases, the loan  is even larger than <b>50% of the national GDP.</b><br>
<img style="border-radius:8px;margin:40px 10px;" class="d-block img-fluid  ml-auto mr-auto"  src="../post/GDP.jpg" alt="GDP stats"><p class="img-caption caption text-center"
 style="margin-top:-40px;font-size:0.8em;border-bottom:50px"> Debts of some Saharan Countries.</p>
 <br>

China doesn't seem to stop even here even once the loan amount starts to exaggerate. China starts pressurizing the host government the other way around by interfering in the country's internal matters. Consequently, once an independent sovereign country, ends up losing a part of their territory. One living example is <b>Sri Lanka's  Hambantota Port </b>that Sri Lanka has ceded to China for<b> almost a Century(99 years) </b>as a settlement against the Chinese investments at Hambantota.<br></p>
<br><img style="border-radius:8px;margin:40px 10px;" class="d-block img-fluid ml-auto mr-auto" src="../post/hambantota.jpeg" alt="hambantota port"><p class="img-caption caption text-center"
 style="margin-top:-40px;font-size:0.8em;border-bottom:50px">Hambantota Port under Chinese control for the next century.</p>
 <br>


<h2><u>China’s Interest in Iran </u></h2>
<p>It seems that this time China's eyeing much more than just Iran's territory. Iran has been blessed with huge energy reserves but the war-torn country doesn't have enough money to make these resources viable. It looks like this is what China is targeting at courtesy its multi-billion dollars investment. It's quite evident from the statement, of the promised $400 billion, <b>$280 billion alone is being spent on developing the oil and gas resources, </b>which in turn will give China access to cheap oil and gas. <br>
But China doesn't plan to stop even there, it's ultimate goal is the expansion of its esteemed<b> Belt and Road initiative</b> through Iran and Kazakh, in order to reduce its dependence on the strategically located, the Strait of Hormuz and the Strait of Malacca.<br>
<img style="border-radius:8px;margin:50px 10px;" class="d-block img-fluid ml-auto mr-auto" src="../post/malacca.jpeg" alt="Strait of Malacca">
<p class="img-caption caption text-center"
 style="margin-top:-50px;font-size:0.8em;border-bottom:50px">Strategic location of Stait of Malacca</p>
 

Well, the <b> Belt and Road Initiative</b> is just one card of China 's brutal Modern day Colonialism. As of now<b>, China aims to bring more than 5000 PLA troops</b>  in Iran along with its investments, for its strategic needs. And I won't be surprised if this number rises exponentially in the near future and  we see a significant amount of PLA troops in Iranian territory . <br>
But why is Iran falling in this trap, don't they know of this trap?<br>
 As of now , I can only figure out one reason for it- <b>Mr. Donald Trump. </b></p><br>



<h2><u>US's Stand on Iran.</u></h2>
<p>To most of the people out there, it seems quite straight forward how the US has left no option for Iran. Have a look through the Indian perspective, not long ago, until the last year India was the largest consumer of Iranian oil. But as of now Indian import of Iranian oil stands to near zero. All thanks to the US sanctions on the bilateral trade with Iran. These sanctions were followed by <b>Trump's withdrawal from the Iran Nuclear Deal.</b> And while all this was going on, the US <b>assassinated Iran's top military leader- Qasem Soleimani</b> during a diplomatic mission to Iraq by a precise drone strike. <br>
Believe me or not, but the US government under<b> Donald Trump has only widened the gap between the Middle-East and the West, </b>which laid down a smooth ride for the Expansionist Communist Nation to jump in the gorge .<br></p><br>

<h2><u>Impact on INDIA </u></h2>
<p>With China shaking hands with Iran, India's diplomatic relation with Tehran has suffered a huge blow. As you all may know, India controls the Chabahar port in Iran and is also developing the Chabahar Railway Project to open the Central Asian Market to the Indian goods. But the recent developments suggest that Tehran has replied to New Delhi that they're developing the project on their own. But it's quite evident that it's  the Chinese regime that's supporting Iran to back out.<br>
The major issue is that the Chabahar project means a lot to us, we have already invested enough in it that we can't afford to lose it at this stage, but the Chinese entry into the region has only made the situation getting worse. At the same time, Iran's envoys to India, <b>Mr. Ali Chegeni's statement has created a turmoil in the political circles</b>. Here's the envoy's statement as he quoted, <b>“India had fought hard for its independence and should not have given it to unilateral sanctions from the US. '' </b><br>
While he was referring to India's shift of oil policy from Iran but this statement itself conveyed a critical message .<br>
Had he said anything irrelevant? Probably not. Infact, I strongly agree with the bureaucrat's statement.<br>
Had <b><u>Vajpayee Ji</u></b> been alive today, he too would have stated the same.</p><br>

<h2><u>Conclusion</u></h2>
<p><b>While the Chinese investment has brought a geo-political imbalance in the region & Iran stands on verge of falling into the Chinese trap abyss, it's just the matter of time before China starts barging into the Iranian territory or India takes a firm stand against the sanctions to be an accomplice for Iran against the filthy Dragon.</b></p>
