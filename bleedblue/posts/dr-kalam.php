                 2020,Jul 27| 12:00 AM<br>By You and Me to him

        <p>Today India has become the world leader with Her leading space technology and missile development programmes. India produces the world's fastest hypersonic ballistic missile, the Brahmos. India makes the world's cheapest and the most efficient satellites. But have you ever thought about how much we have struggled to earn this tag of the Technological Giant? Today we'll go through the story of a man who devoted his entire life to the service of the nation & to get this tag latched to our country's name.<br><br>
Hello BlueBloods,<br><br>
	&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Today, I'm going to tell you about a man who taught us to fly, who provided us with the wings of fire, who instilled in us the power to dream, the man whose life itself  teaches us the lesson of simple living and high thinking.<br><br>
He was the man who rewarded India with the gift of nuclear power. While working at the post of the Chief Scientific Advisor to the Government of India, he was offered the ministerial post by the then Prime Minister, Bharat Ratna Atal Bihari Vajpayee. He politely refused that stating his only will is to bestow this great nation with the power of science and technology and not gain petty fame for his name . But the universe had conspired something else for him<br>.
Let's dive into the nation's Nuclear story and his never-forgettable role to it.</p><br><br>
<h2><u>March 1988</u></h2>
<p>He presented the PM with the layout of Nation's Second Nuclear programme Operation Shakti. But the journey throughout wasn't going to a cakewalk. There were many slips twixt the cup & the lip.</p><br><br>
<h2><u>Operation Shakti</u></h2>
<p> The US had been the biggest roadblock to India's Nuclear Programme. But this man had already planned a way ahead of them.<br><br>
The Pokhran Nuclear Programme was nicknamed Operation Shakti and our leader was christened Major Prithviraj.</p><br><br>
<h2><u>May 11-13,1998</u></h2>
<p>Major Prithviraj had done it. India successfully tested four Nuclear Bombs in quick succession without giving the world the tiniest hint.<br>
But when the world actually came to know about this stealthy mission, Major Prithviraj had already become the crown of Indian Nuclear Power.<br>
Rabindra Nath Tagore was the first to call Gandhi, the Mahatma, but I fear if there is any word in our thesauruses that can do justice to Dr. Kalam's Honor.<br><br>
Bharat Ratna Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam devoted his entire life to the nation. He spent his 40 ever-precious years as a scientist in ISRO and DRDO. He set off as  the backbone of India's civilian space programme and the Military Missile Development efforts. His diligence and valour earned him the title of the righteous “Missile Man of India”. Surely, this is not the only title he has received throughout his life & if I go for a futile recount to all those honours to his name, I'll fail miserably coz we're not gonna sit here for eternity. Dr. Kalam was conferred with India's highest civilian award Bharat Ratna in 1997. The nation's jewel also served as the President of the nation from 2002 to 2007. During his stint of 5 years as the supreme leader of the nation, Dr. Kalam received the honour of being known as The People's President.</p><br>

<h6 class="text-center mt-0 mb-4">The People's President</h6>

<br><br><br><p>Today, this date of 27th July marks the 5th Commemoration Anniversary of the Jewel. It's been 5 years since Dr. Kalam departed this world for the heavenly abode, leaving behind a void that couldn't be filled for the longest time. But as a quite famous English song says, "Legends never die", yeah, they really don't.<br>
May the Almighty bless his soul.</p>
