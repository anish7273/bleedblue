        <img class="d-block img-fluid" src="../post/flag.jpeg" alt="Hong Kong Protests " style="border-radius:4px;margin-bottom:40px;">       
<p>Have you been hearing a lot of Hong Kong these days but simply  choose to ignore and move on considering it an external matter. I’ll give you a few reasons to think again why you should pay attention to it?<br>
But before we start, Let’s see what’s cooking up in our neighbourhood. Well this one’s really  interesting, I personally feel it quite amusing. Its like “Chor ke ghar me hi Chori” which literally means Robbery in Robber’s den. Last Monday a group of terrorists attacked on Pakistan’s stock exchange and quite habitually our dear neighbour have blamed us for it even though the local militant group, Baluchistan Liberation Army takes responsibility of it. Well it’s not new neither for our dear friend nor for us. But what’s new is that their proprietor, China has taken this to an another level. China reached UN for the same and most probably billing  the invoice in India's account.<br>
Fortunately we too have a few friends in UN, if we ourselves can’t be there( All credits to Pundit Ji), US and Germany have blocked China from introducing it in United Nations Security Council.<br>
It appears China is trying to do every bit possible to divert the global attention from its own activities, be it the Wuhan Virus or the Hong Kong's  pro-democracy Campaigns.<br>
<i>Oh! This  reminds me why actually  we are here?</I><br>
<h2><u>National Security Law</u></h2>
<p>Or the so called “Law of People’s Republic of China on safeguarding National Security in Hong Kong Special Autonomous Region.” China has used the ongoing global crisis as the opportunity to introduce the controversial law to end the autonomy of Hong Kong. Since its inception it has become the mouthpiece of every other nation. This arises a couple of questions, Firstly What the hell this law actually means and then why is everyone talking of this?<br>
The draconian law is China’s new tactic to subdue the voice of Hong Kong calling for democracy and independence. Before diving deep into this law, let’s see how Hong Kong was before this law.</p><br>
<h2><u>The Hong Kong’s Administration</u></h2>
<p>Not long before, until 1997 Hong Kong used to be a  British territory. After the loss of Chinese empire to Great Britain in the opium war,  Hong Kong went into British hands for a lease of 99 years which ended in 1997. After that a deal was signed between Britain and China to give Hong Kong back to China for the next 50 years on the condition that Hong Kong would be a special autonomous region, it will follow the ‘One country, Two system' principle. For discernment, consider it like the article 370 and 35A of Indian Constitution. Under this system, Hong Kong has autonomy over its internal matters whereas China will handle it’s defence and foreign policy. <br>
But after the introduction of this law, China wants to overtake the Hong Kong's autonomy. The controversial law, follows the last year’s pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong. These protest seems to be the trigger for Beijing to introduce this law. Wang Chen, Vice-Chairman of the standing committee introducing the law stated-“We must take <u><b>powerful</b> measures to lawfully stop and <b>punish</b> them…”</u></p><br>
<img class="d-block img-fluid" style="border-radius:8px;border:1px solid #c0c0c0;margin-bottom:50px;" src="../post/pic.png" alt="Brutal China">
<p class="img-caption caption text-center" style="margin-top:-50px;font-size:0.8em;border-bottom:50px">Chinese officials dragging pro-democracy activists.</p>
 
<h2><u>The Hong Kong Government</u></h2>
<p>Even after such a bizarre explanation, that totally undermines the Human Rights of people of Hong Kong, Carrie Lam Hong Kong’s Chief executive seemed to be supportive of the law. Anyway Lam’s opinion doesn’t mean much to citizens of Hong Kong as she’s a mere puppet of Chinese Communist Party. The law not just violates their human right but bypasses Hong Kong’s Legislature and Judiciary to give unseeming powers to Chinese government. China has the power to run trial on anyone, whoever it be, that too in a secret way, invisible to the common people so that no-one gets to know about it, on the grounds of National security. What’s more interesting is the Chinese definition of breach of National Security. Subversion, separatism or foreign indulgence, at least this is what the law says but infact there’s no definition of National Security, it’s the Chinese Communist Party that’ll decide what categorises as threat to National security and what not.<br>
Just to explain you the gravity of the situation, If I ever decided to visit Hong Kong or Mainland China (at least in my piped dreams) after writing this article, I’ll considered as a threat to Hong Kong’s National Security and Chinese govt. holds the rights to punishment.</p><br><br>
<h2><u>People’s Reception of the Law</u></h2><br>
<h4 style="font-weight:200;">The End of Hong Kong</h4>
<p>Unlike Carrie, people of Hong Kong not seems much impressed from the law instead it has provoked the people’s sentiments. As the Communist government seems unmoved, people have intensified their ongoing protests, landing a thousands of them in jail on a daily basis.<br>
<i>Doesn’t this seems similar to how we portray our Nation’s freedom fighters be it Subhash Chandra Bose, Bhagat Singh or Sardar Patel.</i><br>
Claudia Yip, A human rights monitor from Hong Kong describes the situation in her statement to BBC as, “I really doubt that anyone in the pro-establishment camps or the Hong Kong Govt has the guts to stand up against the decision. Everyone has been briefed not to make any noise and just to say yes and that’s what Hong Kong’s Lawmakers are saying.”</p><br><br>

<h2><u>International Reception</u></h2>
<p>As of now we haven’t heard much from the Indian government on the National security Law neither it’s time for us to divert our attention from the Galwan Valley. But a lot of foreign governments are critical of the move. Let’s see the views of a few of them.<br>
<h4 style="font-weight:400;"><u>Taiwan</u></h4>
Taiwan has openly welcomed the pro-democracy movements in Hong Kong. Taiwan has even offered assistance to individuals directly facing the axe of Chinese Communist Party on the independence movements.<br>
<h4 style="font-weight:400"><u>United Kingdom</u></h4>
UK has been eyeing on this law since long. Britain’s PM Boris Johnson had said, “ We’ll be looking at the law more carefully and scrutinize it and set out the responses in due course.” And as of now after the inception of the law, UK has even offered citizenship to all citizens born in Hong Kong during the British rule.<br><blockquote class="tw-align-center twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">China has chosen to break their promises to the people of Hong Kong and go against their obligations to the international community.<br><br>🇬🇧 will not turn our backs on the commitments we have made to the people of Hong Kong. <a href="https://t.co/ir19ghzq28">pic.twitter.com/ir19ghzq28</a></p>&mdash; Dominic Raab (@DominicRaab) <a href="https://twitter.com/DominicRaab/status/1277992311633465344?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 30, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
<h4 style="font-weight:400"><u>United States</u></h4>
US has already been head locked with China on various issues be it the trade war, the rising expansionist policy of China or now its military standoff with India. US has now imposed sanctions on Hong Kong, stopped Visa for Chinese officials and looking to impose economic penalties too after this move of China. Correspondingly US Navy has also moved its two Nimitz class aircraft carriers, USS Nimitz and USS Ronald Reagan in the South China Sea due to rising war situations of China with its allies i.e. India and Japan. US Navy also conducted war drills in the sea to send a clear message to China.<br><blockquote class="tw-align-center twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The CCP’s draconian national security law ends free Hong Kong and exposes the Party’s greatest fear: the free will and free thinking of its own people.</p>&mdash; Secretary Pompeo (@SecPompeo) <a href="https://twitter.com/SecPompeo/status/1278113285343260673?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 30, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
<h4 style="font-weight:400"><u>United Nations</u></h4>
These were just the Individual responses a joint statement was also issued by 27 countries at UN human rights council.<br>
Nations including the likes of Britain, France, Germany, and Japan said “Chinese law undermines Hong Kong’s freedom and we are deeply concerned on it. Imposing the law without direct participation of Hong Kong’s People is the defiance of One country Two system policy.”<br>
<i>Doesn’t it sounds familiar. Can you too hear the slogans of “Simon, Go Back” and the visual image of black flags in your psyche. I’m sure many of you will.</i><br><br>
<h2><u>Conclusion</u></h2>
National Security Law is Communist Party’s absolute power exploitation to disdain the autonomy of Hong Kong and freedom of its people.<br>
China has been an expansionist entity under this Communist Government. While Hong Kong has been the Golden egg laying bird for China, it’s greed withstands no limits, this cage of National Security law has demonstrated how much can China sink down to hide its internal fears.
